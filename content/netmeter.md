**About**  
 NetMeter is a small tool for monitoring your network usage. I made this after one of my favourite tools was no longer available without charge, and decided to make a replacement as a personal project. Currently it is only possible to monitor your current network usage, and is meant as an appetizer in its current state.

**Features to come**  
 I am planning to expand it with at least the following features when time allows me:  
 – Graph  
 – Keep track of network usage in past and provide statistics  
 – More customizable in terms of style and settings  
 Plus some more ![:-)](https://nocture.dk/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif)
