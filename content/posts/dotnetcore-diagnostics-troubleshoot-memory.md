In this post I will describe an example of investigating a memory issue in an ASP.NET Core application running as a container on Linux.
This builds on top of the diagnostics tools and making dumps from the running application as described in my previous post (http://localhost:1313/2020/06/17/dotnetcore-diagnostics-tools-and-containers/).
