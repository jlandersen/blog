Yesterday I had the opportunity to give a talk on the new build system in Visual Studio Online at [GOTO Copenhagen](http://gotocon.com). Great conference overall and good questions afterwards! The slides are [available for download](http://gotocon.com/dl/goto-cph-2015/slides/JeppeAndersen_TimeToRetireThatDustyBuildServerADiveIntoTheNewCrossPlatformBuildServiceInVisualStudioOnline.pdf).
