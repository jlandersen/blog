I recently did a  guest mix for a friends radioshow, that was broadcasted on [sense.fm](http://www.sense.fm) – if you should be interested, the mix is available right [here](http://pub.nocture.dk/files/nocture_guest_mix_sensefm.rar).

Me and a friend also finished our mashup of the two songs *“Andain – Beautiful Things”* and *“Armin van Buuren – Face to Face (Martin Roth Remix)”*, which ended up being* “Andain vs. Armin van Buuren – Beautiful Things to Face”. 
We were happy (and a bit proud :)) to see Pedro Del Mar play it on the two popular radio shows “Mellomania” and “Mellomania Vocal Anthems”.
