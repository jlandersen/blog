Hello there, and welcome to my new blog! My name is Jeppe Andersen and I am currently studying Software Engineering at the [computer science department](http://cs.aau.dk) of Aalborg University.

The main content of this blog will also be related to this, which means I am not going to post my everyday happenings, instead this place will be used as a data dump for various things I find interesting. This can be anything from some tech-news to a small implementation of an algorithm I decided to do after a course at the university.

Take care ![:)](https://nocture.dk/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif)
