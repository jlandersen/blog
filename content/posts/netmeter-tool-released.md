I have always been using a small tool to monitor my network usage for various reasons, but recently my favourite decided to take the step away from being a free tool. Instead of tracking down another, I decided to use this opportunity to start a new project of my own, and use it as an opportunity to take a look at [WPF ](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_Presentation_Foundation)for the first time.

Currently it simply displays your network usage, but should only be considered an appetizer in its current state – I got some ideas lined up to give this some more sweet features!
