This saturday I had the opportunity to give a talk at Office 365 Saturday Denmark 2016, on Continuous Deployment with Visual Studio Team Services and Azure. Even though it was a last minute session I put together as a result of another speaker having cancelled due to illness I think it turned out great. Lot's of good questions and interest!

By request, the slides are [available for download](http://www.spsevents.org/city/Copenhagen/Copenhagen2016/Lists/SPSSessions/Attachments/68/O365SDKCD.pdf). Feel free to reach out if you have any questions!
