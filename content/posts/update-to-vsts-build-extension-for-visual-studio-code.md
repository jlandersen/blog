An extension that I otherwise thought to be obsolete as a result of an official VSTS extension for Visual Studio Code having been released, has received an update! The number of downloads keep increasing, and it appears it brings some value in addition to the official extension. will be spending some time over the next weeks bringing a couple of new features to it and trying to get feature requests implemented as well.

My [VSTS Build Status](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=jeppeandersen.vstsbuildstatus) extension has been updated to 0.4.0, receiving a new minor feature - opening builds directly in your browser:
