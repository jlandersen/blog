I am starting to find myself spend more and more time in Visual Studio Code. Instead of going to VSTS project sites to view status of my builds, I decided to put it directly into VS Code as an extension. The extension puts a status icon in the status bar which shows the status of a selected build definition.
You can find the "Visual Studio Team Services Build Status" extension directly in VS Code or the market place [https://github.com/jlandersen/vscode-vsts-build-status](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items/jeppeandersen.vstsbuildstatus) which also shows how to configure the extension with your VSTS account.
